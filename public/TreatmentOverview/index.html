            <h5>Length of Rehabilitation Treatment</h5>
            A social media rehab does not have a set amount of time because treatment depends on the individual. While treatment may last from 28 to 90 days, it should last no fewer than 7 to 10 days. Each patient’s addiction and recovery is unique and it should last as long as is necessary for the individual to receive the necessary care and support to pursue recovery.
            </p>

            <p id="private-treatment">
            <h5>Private Inpatient Social Media Rehab Treatment</h5>
            <p>When it comes to social media treatment centers, there are various types of programs. Most private social media treatment facilities offer inpatient residential rehab. There is both long-term and short-term residential treatment. Inpatient rehab can last for a wide range of time, with long-term residential treatment possibly lasting from 6 to 12 months and short-term residential treatment possibly lasting from 3 to 6 weeks (with variations for both).
            </p>
            <p>Short-term residential programs involve a briefer but intensive treatment based on a 12-step approach. Lasting between 3 to 6 weeks for inpatient care, patients then transition to an extended period of outpatient therapy, as well as participating in self-help groups.
            </p>
            <p>Long-term residential treatment involves care 24 hours a day for an extended period of time. One of the most commonly used residential treatment models is the therapeutic community (TC), which works on the reconnection of individuals with society and lasts between 6 and 12 months.
            </p>
            <p>Both long-term and short-term residential programs involve “detox” as well as intensive social media abuse therapy and aftercare planning.
            </p>
            </p>

            <p id="partial-hospitalization">
            <h5>Partial Hospitalization Programs</h5>
            <p>
                Partial hospitalization programs (PHPs), also sometimes known as day treatment programs, are addiction treatment programs that provide a high level of care but permit patients to live at home during treatment. PHPs offer treatment that is similar to that of inpatient/residential programs. While programs vary, patients typically attend treatment at least 5 days a week for between 4-6 hours each day.
            </p>
            <p>PHPs offer services comparable to a residential inpatient program, including access to mental health care services, if needed. Services available through PHPs may include:

                <div class="list-group-item">
                    <li>One-on-one therapy.</li>
                    <li>Group therapy.</li>
                    <li>Family meetings.</li>
                    <li>Medication management.</li>
                    <li>Drug screening.</li>
                    <li>Medical services.</li>
                    <li>Treatment of co-occurring mental health disorders.</li>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Partial hospitalization may be best for people who need intensive care but have a strong support system outside of treatment that will help them stay off social media. In addition, it may be a good fit for people who are struggling to continue treatment, are at risk of relapse, or have a co-occurring disorder (e.g., depression or PTSD).
