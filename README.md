DEPLOYED WEBSITE: https://relaxed-bhabha-04906a.netlify.app/

This website is intended to mimic existing websites about alcohol addiction. The focus for this project is to shine some light on social media addiction.

In this website, almost all of the tabs in the navigation bar on the top of the page are functional. You can also click and see the Helpline information.

The text has been written by me (Jessie Chin), Brooke Elmore, Emily Liu, and Sadhana Pakala, written with inspiration from https://rehabs.com/treatment/alcohol-rehab-center/ (the website we are imitating).
